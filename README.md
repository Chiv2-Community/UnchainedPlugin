# Unchained Plugin
The unchained plugin patches the Chivalry 2 Binary and allows connection to unofficial servers using an unofficial server browser. It also enables the loading of non-vanilla pak files (mods).

## Version Bumps
To bump the version, the build files must be re-generated. Recompiling via cmake is not enough
